Project 1 - Heady Hecate Resin Art website
https://leesah80.github.io/project01/

Name
Lisa Culver

Overview/description of the project
A portfolio website for Heady Hecate resin art, showcasing custom work

Details on how to use it or what functionality is offered
A simple single page website with a fixed top navigation, logo as the home button. An art gallery to view custom art work, an about section allowing users to get to know more about Heady Hecate, and a contact form for users that would like to request information for custom art. Finally, there is a footer.


Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript

Ideas for future improvement (minimum of 3)
Would like to figure out how to apply javascript for popup images for the gallery rather than going to a new page
Would like to spend more time trying to make the page more interactive
Would have designed it to look nicer
